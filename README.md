# Quotenation
The book readers love to mark their favourite quotes, the binge watchers love to keep a screenshot of their favourite lines, the anime watchers love to save their favourite moments, but what about those whose interest lie in all these fields?
This website will be a common place for them, it serves to provide a space where they can add popular lines if they arenâ€™t already available, save their favourite quotes from the collection we would provide, and even give or get a customised quote along with an image if they prefer.
Hence, the main purpose of the project is to allow people to save and check out popular quotes based on various categories.
